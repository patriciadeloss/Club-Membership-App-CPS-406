# Club-Membership-App-CPS-406
## Description
This program offers a simple system for club managers and club members to sign-up, pay for, and schedule their favorite activity. Both managers and members are able to make accounts. This system allows the club managers to see who has registered, who has paid, and see the financial status of all club activities. The system allows members to register and complete transactions. Further, reminder notifications keep all parties updated about any pertinent changes. Finally, a messaging functionality has also been built in to allow all users to connect with each other.
